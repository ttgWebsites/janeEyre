					<li data-theme="d">The novel begins with a ten-year-old orphan named Jane Eyre who is living with her uncle's 
					family, the Reeds, as her uncle's dying wish.  Jane's Aunt Sarah Reed does not like her and treats her like a servant. 
					She and her three children are abusive to Jane, physically and emotionally.  One day Jane gets locked in the room 
					in which her uncle died, and panics after seeing visions of him. She is finally rescued when she is allowed to attend
					Lowood School for Girls. The eighty pupils at Lowood are subjected to cold rooms, poor meals, and thin clothing. 
					After eight years of school Jane decides to leave, and advertises her services as a governess, and receives one reply. 
					It is from Alice Fairfax, who is a keeper of Thornfield Hall. Odd things happen at the house, and for the rest of the 
					story she leaves and returns to Thornfield Hall encountering strange situations and great revelations.</li>
