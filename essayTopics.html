					<li data-theme="b">What elements do you find similar in the novel to a traditional gothic work of literature and how do they play in to the story being told?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Throughout the novel you see many instances of traditional Gothic literature in the details and settings.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The novel is filled with what is believed to be supernatural occurrences, it is set often times in mysterious remote locations on large estates, and there seems to be an air of mystery throughout Jane's experiences that draw suspense and keep the reader interested.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">However it seems these details are more so included to draw the reader in and keep them guessing till the very end, as many of the supernatural occurrences and much of the mystery and speculation by Jane throughout the novel seems to be explained at the end.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Although there is no explanation for Jane seeing a ghost and hearing Rochester call out for her at the end of the novel, it is most likely that BrontÃ« used the Gothic examples in her text to enhance her story rather than write a traditional Gothic novel.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Would you consider Jane as a likable protagonist?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">For the time period of the novel Jane does not define the typical heroine.
					<li data-theme="c">She lacks great beauty like other female characters mentioned in the novel, however she is still attractive in a traditional and homely sense.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Her character is more easily to relate to in that sense, which perhaps makes her more likable.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Though some readers may find issue with her stern reaction to Rochester's previous marriage and her inability to give into her desires, it should be noted that she has very strong morals which she stands by, which can also be a respected and likable trait.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Jane is a powerful woman in a time period when men held all the power and her strong will and strength to persevere against adversity should be admired.</li>
